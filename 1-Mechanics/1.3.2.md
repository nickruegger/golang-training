# Package Management

ruby has gems, macOS has brew, go has `go mod`

## Concepts

Go Mod is the next iteration of `dep` that is built into go and allows developers to work outside of GOPATH.

Let's create an example project in an empty folder outside of GOPATH:

main.tf
```go
package main

import (
  "github.com/user/project/pkg/hello" // Don't change this for now
)

func main() {
  hello.Greet()
}
```

pkg/hello/greeter.go
```go
package hello

import "fmt"

func Greet() {
  fmt.Println("greetings")
}
```

Remember: the go compiler previously only looks in GOPATH and GOROOT to try to match import paths.

```bash
» go run main.go
main.go:4:4: cannot find package "github.com/user/project/pkg/hello" in any of:
        /usr/local/Cellar/go/1.13.4/libexec/src/github.com/user/project/pkg/hello (from $GOROOT)
        /Users/username/go/src/github.com/user/project/pkg/hello (from $GOPATH)

» go mod init github.com/user/project # Run this as is for now.
go: creating new go.mod: module github.com/user/project

» go run main.go
greetings
```

What happened here? Go now knows to treat this directory as "github.com/user/project", and can resolve the import path.

`go mod init` created a `go.mod` file:

```
module github.com/user/project

go 1.13
```

Let's expand go mod to use remote packages.

main.go
```go
package main

import (
  "github.com/user/project/pkg/hello"
  "github.com/sirupsen/logrus"
)

func main() {
  hello.Greet()
  logrus.Info("hello")
}
```

Let's run `go run main.go` to verify that everything works, then explore go.mod:

```
module github.com/user/project

go 1.13

require github.com/sirupsen/logrus v1.4.2 // indirect
```

We can see that `mod` is now managing the versioned logrus dependency in go.mod.
Similar to GOPATH/src, go mod stores its dependencies in GOPATH/pkg/mod instead of GOPATH/src.

We can see the `// indirect` comment because `go run` wrote to the file. If we remove the last line entirely and run `go mod tidy` we will see it without the comment.
Usually, the `// indirect` comment tells us that a package we depend on is depending on yet another package.

That's it! You can now forget everything you knew about GOPATH and GOROOT.
