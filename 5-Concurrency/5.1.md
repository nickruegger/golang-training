# Goroutines

## Concepts

**goroutines** are functions that run concurrently:

```go
package main

import (
    "fmt"
    "time"
)

func main() {
    go sayHi("Andrew")
    go sayHi("Beavis")
    go sayHi("Cory")
    time.Sleep(1 * time.Second)
}

func sayHi(name string) {
    fmt.Printf("Hi %s\n", name)
}
```

If this is run 3 times, there could be 3 different orderings of names because each sayHi is run concurrently.

`time.Sleep` is required at the end because if `main` exits while the goroutines are running, the program will end.

Next we will take a look at how to orchestrate goroutines and share state. Before we move on, we are going to refactor the above example:

```go
package main

import (
    "fmt"
    "time"
)

func main() {
    for _, name := range []string{"Andrew", "Beavis", "Cory"} {
        go sayHi(n)
    }
    time.Sleep(1 * time.Second)
}

func sayHi(n string) {
    fmt.Println(n)
}
```

## Exercises

Refactor the above to use an anonymous function.

## Tips

- "Concurrency is about dealing with lots of things at once. Parallelism is about doing lots of things at once." - Rob Pike
