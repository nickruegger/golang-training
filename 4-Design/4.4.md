# init()

## Concepts

Every package can have an `init()` function. For non-main packages, `init()` is run when the package is imported. For main, `init()` is run before `main()` begins.

This is often used to initialize any variables or external network connections needed.

```go
package main

import "fmt"

var (
    a int
    b string
)
func init() {
    a = 4
    fmt.Println("1. Initialized")
}

func main() {
    b = "hello"
    fmt.Println("2. Started")
    fmt.Println(a, b)
}
```

Sometimes, you would like to run the init function from a package, but don't intend to use any exported names in the package:

```go
package main

import _ "github.com/user/project/pkg/example"

func main() {
    ...
}
```

Importing a package without using it in go is an error. Including the `_` before the import path tells the go compiler that no exported names are going to be used.


## Exercises

## Tips

- You can have multiple `init()` functions in the same file. They will be called in order.
