# Testing

## Concepts
Go has two features to make testing a core component:
- the testing command `go test ...`
- the testing package `testing`

By convention, tests live in the same folder as the package files and have the filename X_test.go for every X.go. If you'd like to test **unexported names**, the package name of the test must match the package it's testing. Otherwise, you can name the package X_test to test only **exported names**.

To run tests, you can navigate to the directory that contains tests and run `go test` or `go test X_test.go`.
If you'd like to run all tests for a project, navigate to the root of the project and run `go test ./...`

Let's look at an example test file:

```go
package main // or main_test

func TestSomething(t *testing.T) {
    // Include logic here
    t.Error("Failed because of ...")
}
```

Functions must be named TestX if they are to be run with `go test`.

Go does not include **assertions** and instead guides users to use if statements to trigger `t.Error`s. However, there are 3rd party [testing frameworks](https://github.com/stretchr/testify) if assertions are what you need.

## Exercises

Implement tests for the square root function in [4.2](4.2.md)

## Tips

- [Table Driven Tests](https://github.com/golang/go/wiki/TableDrivenTests) are a great way to organize many test cases.

## Further Reading
- Look at the tests in each test/ directory in this repo.
- Explore the math/rand stdlib tests by inspecting `GOOROOT/src/math/rand`.
