# Interfaces

## Concepts

Interfaces allow programmers to decouple software by adhering to the dependency inversion principle.
At a high level, an interface defines a method contract on structs:

```go
package main

import (
    "fmt"
    "strings"
)

type pet interface {
    Sound(int) string
    NumLegs() int
}

type dog struct {}

func (d dog) Sound(length int) string {
    return strings.Repeat("woof ", length)
}

func (d dog) NumLegs() int {
    return 4
}

func Output(p pet) {
    fmt.Printf("He walks on %d legs and makes the sound %s", p.NumLegs(), p.Sound(2))
}

func main() {
    d := dog{}
    Output(d)
}
```

`Output` can be called on `d` because `dog` implements all the methods in the `pet` interface.

Unlike java, go interfaces are implemented implicitly: there is no need to tell the compiler that we want `dog` to adhere to the `pet` interface.

## Exercises

Create a package that defines an interface and functions on the interface, and in main create structs that adhere to the interface. Run the package functions on the structs.

## Tips
- "The bigger the interface, the weaker the abstraction" - Rob Pike.
- The **empty interface** (`interface{}`) means that any data type could be the argument.

## Further Reading

Similar to the further reading in [Structs 3.2](../3-Data/3.2.md), Interfaces also support composition. The [io package](https://golang.org/pkg/io/#ReadCloser) has a lot of great examples:
  - `go doc io Reader`
  - `go doc io Writer`
  - `go doc io ReadWriter`
