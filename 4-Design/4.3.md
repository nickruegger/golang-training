# Logging

## Concepts

The standard library includes the logging package "log".

The log package includes the functions:
- Print, Printf, Println
- Fatal, Fatalf, Fatalln
- Panic, Panicf, Panicln

Where fatal calls `os.Exit(1)` and panic calls `panic()`.

Each log will appear on its own line with the date and time, and SetPrefix will add a prefix.

```go
package main

import "log"

func main() {
    log.SetPrefix("Info: ")
    log.Print("Started")
    log.Panic("Errored!")
}
```

## Further Reading
The base log package is minimal, because no one logging solution will fit everyone's needs, be it log levels, speed, convenience, structured logs, etc. Find a logging solution that works for you. Some of the most popular include [logrus](https://github.com/sirupsen/logrus) and [glog](https://github.com/golang/glog).
