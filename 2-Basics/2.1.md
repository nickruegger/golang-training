# Types

## Concepts

There are [26](https://github.com/golang/go/blob/master/src/reflect/type.go#L233) types in golang

### Basic Types
string type: `string`

boolean type: `bool`

numeric types:
  - `int`, `int8`, `int16`, `int32`, `int64`
  - `uint8`, `uint16`, `uint32`, `uint64`
  - `float32`, `float64`
  - `complex32`, `complex64`

Let's see some examples of types:

```go
package main

import "fmt"

func main() {
  fmt.Println("hello", true, 1, 3.4, 2+3i)
  fmt.Printf("%T %T %T %T %T\n", "hello", true, 1, 3.4, 2+3i)
}
```

## Exercises
What happens when you add an int to a float64? What about two strings?

## Tips

- The general rule of thumb is to use sized ints for data, and `int` for indexing, length, and capacity.


## Further Reading

While most of the remaining types are covered in the next modules, be aware that **type aliases** exist. They are not covered because they are rarely used and [often introduce anti-patterns](https://alehatsman.com/post/golang_type_declaration_abuse.html).
